Cascade practice with relationships

DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself!

Bang important (!important)
- use it at the end of the declaration before the semicolon
- use it to force style
- can never be overridden
- use it ONLY if client project is due ASAP & need time to hash out the issue later

Note: Relationships are flexible without a caret vs direct with a caret. Sometimes,preference doesn't matter.
